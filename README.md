Full Stack Engineer Assignment - Department Management API
Overview
This project is a backend API built with NestJS, GraphQL, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication. It allows users to manage departments and sub-departments, with basic CRUD operations and secure authentication using JWT tokens. The API is hosted on Render.com.

Technologies Used
NestJS - Framework for building the API.
GraphQL - Query language for APIs, used to interact with the backend.
TypeORM - ORM for managing PostgreSQL database.
PostgreSQL - Relational database used for storing departments and sub-departments.
JWT (JSON Web Token) - For secure authentication and authorization.
Class-Validator & Class-Transformer - Used for input validation.
Features
Authentication: Login endpoint with JWT authentication.
CRUD Operations:
Create Department: Create a department with or without sub-departments.
Read Departments: Fetch all departments and their sub-departments.
Update Department: Modify department names.
Delete Department: Delete a department and its associated sub-departments.
Create/Update/Delete Sub-Departments (optional).
Input Validation: Ensures all inputs meet specific validation criteria.
Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)
PostgreSQL database
A Render.com account for hosting the API.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/department-management-api.git
cd department-management-api
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

env
Copy code
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdatabase
Run the application locally:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
The API will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Database Setup
Make sure your PostgreSQL database is set up. You can create the database manually or use a tool like TypeORM CLI to generate and run migrations:

Generate migration files:

bash
Copy code
npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -n InitialMigration
Run migrations:

bash
Copy code
npm run typeorm migration:run
This will create the necessary tables for departments and sub-departments in your PostgreSQL database.

how to start a new nest js server 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To start a new NestJS server, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm
First, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can check if they are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
If they are not installed, download and install Node.js from the official website, which will include npm.

2. Install NestJS CLI
NestJS has a powerful CLI tool that simplifies the creation and management of NestJS applications.

To install the NestJS CLI globally, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
3. Create a New NestJS Project
Once the NestJS CLI is installed, you can generate a new project by using the following command:

bash
Copy code
nest new project-name
Replace project-name with the name of your project.

This will create a new directory named project-name, where NestJS will set up the basic folder structure for your application.

The CLI will prompt you to choose a package manager (npm or yarn). Choose npm unless you specifically want to use yarn.

4. Install Dependencies
After the project is created, navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd project-name
NestJS already installs all the necessary dependencies, but if for any reason you need to install them manually, you can run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
5. Run the Development Server
Now that everything is set up, you can start the NestJS development server with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
Alternatively, for automatic reloading of your application during development, you can use:

bash
Copy code
npm run start:dev
By default, your server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

6. Open the Application
You can now open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see your running NestJS application. You should see a message that says Hello World! if everything was set up correctly.

Folder Structure
After the server starts, the folder structure of the NestJS project will look something like this:

bash
Copy code
project-name/
│
├── src/                # Main source code folder
│   ├── app.controller.ts
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── app.service.ts
│   └── main.ts         # Entry point of the application
│
├── test/               # Folder for unit and e2e tests
│
├── node_modules/       # Node.js dependencies
├── package.json        # Project metadata and dependencies
└── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
You can start building your app by adding new modules, controllers, and services inside the src/ folder.

That’s it! You’ve successfully created and started a new NestJS server.
